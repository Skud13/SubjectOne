SubjectOne - Dietary Logging

The purpose of this is to log daily intake and check against a predefined diet profile and advise if on target. 
Intake objects can be obtained from other resources such as Web pages or manually entered or overridden. 
Initially a diet profile for the user will be configured in terms of the required result e.g. 
   - weight gain/loss/stability/limit,maximise or exclude food groups
   - target calories per day
   - eating patterns (shift workers, anyone on a body training or sports programme using target /event driven targets)
   - supplement advice
   - some loose guidance regarding medicines 
       (although we always suggest that you should consult a GP if the user is taking anything or has an medical condition).

Items can be selected throughout the day with weight or volume details the daily intake will be shown as a chart of what is left and what food groups are required to meet the desired profile.
